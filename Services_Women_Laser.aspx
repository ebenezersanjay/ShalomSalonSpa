            Traditional hair removal routines can be tedious, painful and expensive over time. Shaving may last a day, waxing a couple of weeks, but none of them last forever. 
            Laser hair removal is an FDA-approved process of permanently reducing or eliminating unwanted hair. At Shalom, we offer the best and most modern technology to assure you a comfortable and effective treatment towards achieving smooth, hair-free skin efficiently, and affordably.
            We offer services for laser hair removal for face, ears, back, chest, half arm & legs.

            Laser Skin Rejuvenation is a treatment that uses light energy to stimulate natural collagen growth and remove irregular pigmentation such as facial redness or rosacea, enlarged blood vessels, facial veins, acne scarring, or wrinkles.
        </p>
        <p>
            The laser’s light harmlessly passes through the upper layer of skin, while its heat stimulates collagen growth deep beneath your skin. This collagen will continue to multiply after the treatment. Over the next months, your body will slowly and naturally fill in wrinkles or scars. Also, because this laser skin treatment does not injure the outer layer of skin, there is no prolonged healing process.

            Skin tags are benign growths that look like soft little balloons of hanging skin, suspended by a small narrow stalk. These growths can be quite a nuisance, and are generally not aesthetically pleasing.
